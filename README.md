# Page report and hack powers! 
Solutions for the set of recruitment tasks from the Clearcode company.

## Project description
The file page_report.py might be used for summarising the website traffic based on the log file.
It returns to the standard output a summary of websites traffic and number of visits in the CSV format: stripped url,requests_count.
It also counts number of invalid logs in the log file and returns the information about it to the standard error.

Files hack_power.py and hack_power_extra.py have no practical use and they are just solutions for the first task given to me. 
I've decided to code the exceptional part of the task as a form of a practice (coded and described in hack_power_extra.py)

## Getting started
To run page_report.py download the project, go to it's location, open a command line from this directory and type:
python page_report.py name_of_a_log_file.log
